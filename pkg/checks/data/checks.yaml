- name: Containerd version is supported
  checkType: containerd-version-on-nodes
  semver: 
    - "~1.6.26-0"
    - "~1.7.7-0"
  howToFix: |
    Use a Kubernetes version/provider that comes with the supported version of containerd.
    e.g. for local setup, you can use k3d provided image and run a cluster as follows:

    k3d cluster create wasm-cluster --image ghcr.io/spinkube/containerd-shim-spin/k3d:v0.13.1  --api-port 6551 -p '8082:80@loadbalancer' --agents 2

- name: Containerd shim is installed and configured
  checkType: binary-installed-on-nodes
  resourceName: containerd-shim-spin-v2

- name: Spin App CRD is installed
  checkType: crd
  resourceName: spinapps.core.spinoperator.dev
  howToFix: |
    To use SpinKube, you need to install SpinApp CRD. It can be installed using following command:

    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator/releases/download/v0.1.0/spin-operator.crds.yaml

- name: Spin App Executor CRD is installed
  checkType: crd
  resourceName: spinappexecutors.core.spinoperator.dev
  howToFix: |
    To use SpinKube, you need to install SpinApp CRD. It can be installed using following command:

    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator/releases/download/v0.1.0/spin-operator.crds.yaml

- name: Cert Manager CRD is installed
  checkType: crd
  resourceName: certificates.cert-manager.io
  howToFix: |
    To use SpinKube, you need to install Cert Manager. This is used for issuing certificates required by Spin Operator Webhooks.
    Cert Manager CRD's can be installed using following command:

    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.14.3/cert-manager.crds.yaml

- name: Cert Manager is running
  checkType: deployment-running
  resourceName: "cert-manager"
  howToFix: |
    To use SpinKube, you need to install Cert Manager. This is used for issuing certificates required by Spin Operator Webhooks.
    Cert Manager can be installed using following command:

    # Add and update Jetstack repository
    helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
    helm repo update

    # Install the cert-manager Helm chart
    helm install \
      cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
      --namespace cert-manager \
      --create-namespace \
      --version v1.14.3

- name: Runtime Class is installed
  checkType: runtimeclass
  resourceName: wasmtime-spin-v2
  howToFix: |
    To use SpinKube, you need to install RuntimeClass. This helps scheduler to identify which nodes support running Spin Apps.

    Note: If you are deploying to a production cluster that only has a shim on a subset of nodes, youâ€™ll need to modify the RuntimeClass with a nodeSelector.

    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator/releases/download/v0.1.0/spin-operator.runtime-class.yaml

- name: Spin Operator is running
  checkType: deployment-running
  resourceName: "spin-operator-controller-manager"
  imageName: spin-operator
  semver:
    - ">=0.1.0"
  howToFix: |
    To use SpinKube, you need to install Spin Operator. This watches for SpinApp CRD resources and deploys the SpinApps on the cluster.
    Cert Manager can be installed using following command:

    # Install Spin Operator with Helm
    helm install spin-operator \
      --namespace spin-operator \
      --create-namespace \
      --version 0.1.0 \
      --wait \
